# Deploy a ML model with `fastapi` and Heroku

This project is a very basic demo of how to deploy a trained machine learning model as REST API in the web, using:
* `sklearn` for model training
* `fastapi` for REST API creation
* **Heroku** for free deployment on the web
 
The prediction REST API is available at https://fastapiroku-ml.herokuapp.com/

### Heroku deployment

I followed this tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-your-fastapi-app-on-heroku-for-free-8d4271a4ab9
